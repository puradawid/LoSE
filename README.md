# LoSE - Laws of Software Engieering

This repository collects all laws that are applicable to software engineering.

## What Is 'Software Engineering'?

Using the definition introduced by Ian Sommervile, software engienering is

> (...) an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use. [[Sommerville]]

Based on this definition, software engieering is everything related to the creation or maitenance of software systems of any kind. It assumes there is a certain subset of activities that are common for all software.

## Definitions

### Problem

For this document, a problem is a complex matter to solve by a software system. A problem is usually hard to define or describe. Examples: aircraft control, calculator, operating system.

### Program

A set of instructions ran by a computer. A program is usually complicated (can be simple) and run by a single processor - so it's not complex. Program can run other program, subroutine, dynamic library, which sometimes can make it complex (interactions with any program are complex).

### Software System

A set of programs, services, and hardware that solves particular set of problems. Containing complicated programs, the system is usually complex (as their interactions).
